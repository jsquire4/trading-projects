Meridian
Project Title: Gauntlet Name: Meridian
Subtitle: Binary Stock Outcome Markets on Blockchain
Project Overview
Design and build a non-custodial decentralized application that enables trading of binary
outcome contracts tied to the daily closing prices of MAG7 US equities (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL,
AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA). Each contract asks a simple question — "Will [STOCK] close
above [PRICE] today?" — and pays out $1 USDC if yes, $0 if no. Contracts expire same-day
(0DTE) and settle at 4:00 PM ET using an on-chain price oracle. Users trade two
complementary token types — Yes and No — on an on-chain order book. No KYC, no custody,
no margin.
Problem Statement
Build a system where users can trade binary outcome tokens on whether a specific stock will
close above a given strike price today. Enforce a fixed $1.00 USDC payout invariant (Yes
payout + No payout = $1.00, always), automate daily market creation and settlement via a price
oracle, and provide a trading interface on an on-chain order book.
Implement the full daily lifecycle:
● Morning: Automated creation of strike-level markets for each of the 7 stocks
● Intraday: Users trade Yes/No tokens on the order book
● 4:00 PM ET: Settlement via oracle — each contract resolves to $1 or $0
● Post-settlement: Users redeem winning tokens for USDC
Business Context & Impact
Business Context
Binary outcome markets offer a simple, intuitive way for retail participants to express directional
views on real-world events. Applying this model to daily stock price levels creates a familiar,

high-frequency product where participants answer questions like: "Will META close above $680
today?" The binary structure eliminates complexity — max gain is known at entry, max loss is
known at entry. No Greeks, no margin calls, no unlimited downside.
Building this on a high-performance blockchain with a non-custodial architecture (user wallets,
on-chain order book, oracle settlement) removes intermediaries and makes the system
transparent and auditable.
Key Impact Metrics
● Correctness: 100% of settlements pay the correct side; the $1.00 invariant is never
violated
● Liveness: Markets created before market open and settled within 10 minutes of market
close every trading day
● Operability: Full lifecycle demo reproducible on testnet — create → mint → trade →
settle → redeem
● Documentation: Clear rationale for all architecture and chain decisions; trade-offs
explained
Technical Requirements
Preferred Languages & Frameworks
● Smart contract: Rust (using the Anchor framework on Solana) is preferred. Solidity on
an EVM-compatible L2 is also acceptable, though EVM chains may introduce latency
challenges for on-chain order book performance.
● Frontend: TypeScript and React (Next.js recommended)
● Automation service: TypeScript / Node.js
Chain Requirements
● Must deploy to a blockchain (L1 or L2) with sub-second finality — fast enough to support
real-time order book trading
● Solana is the recommended chain given its transaction speed and existing order book
infrastructure
● EVM L2s (e.g., Arbitrum, Base) are acceptable alternatives, but be prepared to justify
how order book latency is handled
● HyperLiquid is worth considering as an alternative, though it may not natively support
this type of custom instrument at this time — research and document feasibility if you
explore this path
● If using Solana, deployment to Solana devnet is required to pass. Include reproducible
scripts to deploy and run the full lifecycle on devnet.

● Use standard dev tools for your chosen chain; be prepared to justify your choices
● Secrets via environment variables; provide .env.example
● Never use mainnet or real funds for the core submission
Other Requirements
● Include a short risks/limitations note (no regulatory or compliance claims)
● Avoid unnecessary third-party abstractions; justify all major dependencies
Core Concepts
What Is a Meridian Contract?
A Meridian contract is a pair of complementary tokens — Yes and No — representing a binary
outcome tied to a stock's closing price relative to a specific strike level on a given trading day.
● Yes token: Pays $1.00 USDC if the stock closes at or above the strike price. Pays $0
otherwise.
● No token: Pays $1.00 USDC if the stock closes below the strike price. Pays $0
otherwise.
● Invariant: Yes payout + No payout = $1.00 USDC. Always. For every contract.
Example: Contract: "META closes above $680 today?"
● META closes at $685 → Yes pays $1.00, No pays $0.00
● META closes at $675 → Yes pays $0.00, No pays $1.00
● META closes at exactly $680 → Yes pays $1.00, No pays $0.00 (at-or-above rule)
Pricing Relationship
Because Yes + No always equals $1.00:
● If Yes trades at $0.65, No is implicitly worth $0.35
● The Yes price approximates the market-implied probability that the stock closes at or
above the strike
● Both tokens trade on the same order book (Yes token vs USDC)
What Is a CLOB?

A CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) is a trading mechanism that matches buy and sell orders
based on price-time priority. Bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders) are posted to the book, and
the matching engine fills orders when a bid price meets or exceeds an ask price.
For Meridian, each strike market has one order book where Yes tokens are traded against
USDC. You can either:
● Use an existing on-chain CLOB already deployed on your chosen chain (e.g., Phoenix
on Solana, or similar protocols on EVM chains)
● Build a minimal order book as part of your smart contract (more ambitious, but
demonstrates deeper understanding)
The CLOB is the trading venue. Your smart contract handles minting, settlement, and
redemption; the CLOB handles price discovery and matching.
What Is an Oracle?
An oracle is a service that brings real-world data (in this case, stock prices) onto the blockchain.
Your smart contract cannot natively access stock prices — it needs an oracle to provide them.
For Meridian, you need an oracle that can:
● Provide the previous day's closing price (for strike calculation each morning)
● Provide the current day's closing price at 4:00 PM ET (for settlement)
● Be read on-chain by your smart contract during the settlement transaction
● Include a staleness check (price must be recent) and a confidence/quality check
You must choose and integrate a price oracle available on your chosen chain. Popular options
exist on both Solana and EVM chains. Justify your choice.
The Order Book — One Book, Two Perspectives
This is the most important architectural concept in Meridian. Each strike (e.g., "META > $680")
has exactly one order book — the Yes token traded against USDC. But this single book
serves all four user actions by flipping the perspective.
How It Works
The order book has two sides:
● Bid side: People wanting to buy Yes tokens (they believe the stock will close above the
strike)

● Ask side: People wanting to sell Yes tokens (they believe the stock will close below the
strike, or they are exiting a Yes position)
Because Yes + No = $1.00, selling a Yes token is economically identical to buying a No token.
The order book doesn't need a separate No side — the No perspective is just the inverse of the
Yes book.
The Four Trade Paths on One Book
● Buy Yes — The user buys Yes tokens from the ask side of the book. They now hold Yes
tokens and profit if the stock closes above the strike.
● Buy No — The user mints a Yes/No pair (depositing $1.00 USDC), then sells the Yes
token on the bid side of the book. They keep the No token. The effective cost of the No
token = $1.00 − the Yes sale price.
● Sell Yes — The user sells their Yes tokens on the ask side of the book, receiving USDC.
This closes their Yes position.
● Sell No — The user places a No-backed bid on the book (side=2). When matched
against a Yes ask, the matching engine burns both the Yes and No tokens from escrow
and splits the $1 USDC between both parties. The user receives USDC directly — they
never hold both tokens.
Key insight: Buy Yes and Sell No are the same side of the book (both consume Yes asks).
Buy No and Sell Yes are the same side of the book (both consume Yes bids). One book, four
user actions, two perspectives.
UX Abstraction
To the user, the frontend presents a simple experience:
● "Buy Yes" and "Sell Yes" buttons for the bullish view
● "Buy No" and "Sell No" buttons for the bearish view
The user doesn't need to understand that Buy No is actually a mint-and-sell-Yes operation, or
that Sell No places a No-backed bid that triggers a merge/burn on fill. The frontend translates
their intent into the correct order book action. Under the hood, it's all one book.
Position Constraints
● A user should not be able to Buy Yes if they already hold No tokens for the same strike
without first selling (closing) their No position. Holding both Yes and No simultaneously is
only a transient state during the mint-pair operation — it should not be a persistent user
position from the trading UI.
● Similarly, a user should not Buy No if they already hold Yes tokens for the same strike
without first selling their Yes position.
● The frontend should enforce this by checking the user's token balances before
presenting trade options and guiding them to exit their current position first.

Underlying Assets
The 7 stocks supported in V1 (the "MAG7"):
● AAPL (Apple)
● MSFT (Microsoft)
● GOOGL (Alphabet)
● AMZN (Amazon)
● NVDA (NVIDIA)
● META (Meta Platforms)
● TSLA (Tesla)
Strike Selection
Each morning before market open, the automation service creates strikes for each stock. Strikes
are placed at user-determined percentage intervals above and below the previous closing price,
rounded to the nearest $10.
Algorithm
● Read previous closing price from the oracle
● Generate strikes at ±3%, ±6%, and ±9% from the previous close, rounded to the nearest
$10
● This produces 6 strikes per stock (3 above, 3 below), plus optionally the rounded
previous close itself as a 7th strike
● Admin can add or adjust strikes before or during the trading day
Example: META (prev close $680)
● −9%: $620 → "META > $620"
● −6%: $640 → "META > $640"
● −3%: $660 → "META > $660"
● Close: $680 → "META > $680"
● +3%: $700 → "META > $700"
● +6%: $720 → "META > $720"
● +9%: $740 → "META > $740"
Example: AAPL (prev close $230)

● −9%: $210 → "AAPL > $210"
● −6%: $220 → "AAPL > $220"
● −3%: $220 → "AAPL > $220" (rounds same as −6% for low-priced stocks —
deduplicate)
● Close: $230 → "AAPL > $230"
● +3%: $240 → "AAPL > $240"
● +6%: $240 → "AAPL > $240" (same — deduplicate)
● +9%: $250 → "AAPL > $250"
After deduplication, AAPL would have 5 unique strikes: $210, $220, $230, $240, $250.
Strikes far from the current price will trade near $1.00 (deep in-the-money) or near $0.00 (deep
out-of-the-money). The most active trading happens at strikes near the current stock price.
User Stories
Buy Yes (Bullish)
● User connects wallet and sees their USDC balance
● User browses active contracts grouped by stock ticker
● User selects "META > $680" and sees current Yes/No prices
● User places a buy order (market or limit) on the order book
● Wallet prompts user to sign the transaction
● After execution, Yes token balance appears in portfolio
● Implied No price ($1.00 − Yes price) is displayed
● If user already holds No tokens for this strike, the UI prompts them to sell No first before
buying Yes
Buy No (Bearish)
● Buying No is a first-class action ("Buy No" button), not a secondary workflow
● No price = $1.00 − Yes ask price
● Market order: atomic transaction that mints a Yes/No pair, immediately sells Yes at best
bid — user keeps No tokens. One wallet approval.
● Limit order: atomic transaction that mints a pair, posts Yes as a limit sell at user-chosen
price. User holds both tokens until the Yes sell fills.
● After execution, No token balance appears in portfolio
● If user already holds Yes tokens for this strike, the UI prompts them to sell Yes first
before buying No
Sell Yes (Exit Bullish)

● User selects their Yes position and clicks "Sell Yes"
● This places a sell order for Yes tokens on the ask side of the order book
● User receives USDC when the order fills
● Portfolio updates with realized P&L (entry price vs sale price)
Sell No (Exit Bearish)
● User selects their No position and clicks "Sell No"
● Under the hood, this places a No-backed bid (side=2) on the order book
● When matched against a Yes ask, the matching engine burns both Yes and No tokens
from escrow and splits the $1 USDC between both parties
● The user receives USDC directly — they never hold both tokens simultaneously
● Portfolio updates with realized P&L
Settlement & Redemption
● Settlement occurs automatically via the automation service at ~4:05 PM ET
● The settlement price and outcome (above/below strike) are displayed per contract
● Winning tokens show $1.00 payout; losing tokens show $0.00
● User clicks "Redeem," signs one transaction to burn tokens and receive USDC
● USDC arrives directly in the connected wallet
● Unredeemed tokens remain redeemable indefinitely
Market Maker — Mint & Quote
● Deposit $1.00 USDC per pair to mint 1 Yes + 1 No token
● Post limit orders for Yes tokens on the order book
● See exposure, fills, and P&L in a dashboard or portfolio view
Daily Lifecycle
● 8:00 AM ET: Automation service reads previous close from oracle, calculates strikes
● 8:30 AM ET: Creates contracts and order books for each strike
● 9:00 AM ET: Markets visible on frontend, minting enabled
● 9:30 AM ET: US market open, live trading begins
● 4:00 PM ET: US market close
● ~4:05 PM ET: Automation service reads oracle closing price, settles all contracts
● 4:05 PM ET+: Redemption enabled — winners claim USDC
● Ongoing: Unredeemed tokens remain redeemable indefinitely

Smart Contract Functions
The following functions must exist in your on-chain program. Names are descriptive — use
whatever naming convention fits your chain:
● Initialize Config — One-time setup of global configuration: admin authority, supported
tickers, oracle feed references
● Create Strike Market — Create a single contract for one stock, one strike, one day.
Includes creating the Yes/No token mints, the collateral vault, and the associated order
book market. Called once per strike (not batched).
● Add Strike — Admin function to add extra strikes for a stock intraday
● Mint Pair — Any user deposits $1.00 USDC into the vault, receives 1 Yes token + 1 No
token
● Settle Market — Reads the oracle closing price and writes the binary outcome (Yes
wins or No wins) to the contract. Can only be called after 4:00 PM ET. Must validate
oracle data freshness and confidence.
● Admin Settle (Override) — Admin-only fallback for when the oracle fails. Must enforce
a time delay (e.g., 1 hour after market close) before it can be called. Used only in
emergencies.
● Redeem — Any token holder burns their tokens and receives the payout from the vault.
Winning tokens pay $1.00; losing tokens pay $0.00.
● Pause / Unpause — Admin can pause minting and trading in an emergency
Settlement Logic
● Read the oracle's closing price for the stock
● For each contract:
○ If closing price ≥ strike price → Yes payout = $1.00, No payout = $0.00
○ If closing price < strike price → Yes payout = $0.00, No payout = $1.00
● Write the outcome to the contract's on-chain account. Mark as settled. Outcome is
immutable once written.
Invariants (Must Be Enforced On-Chain)
● Vault balance = $1.00 × total pairs minted (exact — fees, if any, must go to a separate
account)
● Yes payout + No payout = $1.00 (at settlement, always)
● Tokens can only be created via the mint pair function
● Tokens can only be destroyed via the redeem function

● Settlement outcome is immutable once written
Oracle Integration
You must choose and integrate a price oracle. Regardless of which oracle you select, the
following behaviors are required:
● Settlement price read: The settle function must read the stock's closing price on-chain
from the oracle during the settlement transaction
● Staleness check: Reject prices older than a defined threshold (e.g., 5 minutes)
● Confidence check: Reject prices where the oracle's reported confidence band is too
wide (configurable threshold)
● Pre-market price read: The automation service reads the previous day's close from the
oracle (can be off-chain API) to calculate strikes each morning
● Failure handling: If the oracle is unavailable or unreliable at settlement time, the
automation service retries for a defined window (e.g., 15 minutes). If still failing, admin
uses the override settle function with a manual price and enforced time delay.
Frontend Application
Pages
● Landing — Product explanation, live prices, connect wallet call-to-action
● Markets — Grid of 7 stocks with live prices and active contract counts
● Trade — Strike list for the selected stock, order book (showing both Yes and No
perspectives), Buy Yes / Buy No / Sell Yes / Sell No panel
● Portfolio — Active positions, settled outcomes, P&L, redeem buttons
● History — Trade execution log
Key UI Elements
● Contract cards showing strike, current Yes/No prices, and implied probability
● Real-time order book from the CLOB, displayed for both Yes and No perspectives (same
book, two views)
● Trade panel with Buy Yes / Buy No and Sell Yes / Sell No, with position-aware
constraints (can't buy Yes if holding No, and vice versa, without exiting first)
● Settlement countdown timer to 4:00 PM ET
● Simple payoff display: "You pay $X. You win $1.00 if [STOCK] closes above [STRIKE]."
● Portfolio with entry price, current price, P&L, and redeem button for settled contracts

Automation Service
An off-chain service that runs two scheduled jobs on US trading days:
● Morning job (~8:00 AM ET): For each of the 7 stocks, read previous close from oracle,
calculate strikes, call create strike market for each. Log results. Alert on failure. Retry
with backoff.
● Settlement job (~4:05 PM ET): For each open contract, call settle market. If oracle
confidence is too wide, retry every 30 seconds for up to 15 minutes. If still failing, alert
admin for manual override.
This service should live in the same repo as the smart contract and frontend.
Testing Requirements
Smart Contract Tests
● Unit tests for all core functions (mint, settle, redeem, etc.)
● Settlement logic: test at-strike, above-strike, below-strike outcomes
● Invariant tests: Yes payout + No payout = $1.00 for all possible prices
● Vault balance invariant after every mint and redeem operation
● Oracle validation: stale price, wide confidence band, valid price scenarios
● Admin override with time delay enforcement
Integration Tests
● Full lifecycle: create market → mint pair → trade on order book → settle → redeem
● All 4 trade paths: Buy Yes, Buy No, Sell Yes, Sell No
● Multi-user scenario: one user mints and quotes, another takes, both redeem
Frontend Tests
● Wallet connection flow
● Order placement and transaction signing
● Real-time price display from oracle
● Order book rendering and updates (both Yes and No views of the same book)
● Position constraint enforcement (can't hold both Yes and No simultaneously from
trading)
● Portfolio and P&L accuracy

● Settlement display and redeem flow
Deployment & Success Criteria
Required: Testnet Deployment
● Deploy the full system to Solana devnet (or equivalent testnet for your chosen chain)
● Include reproducible scripts/commands to deploy contracts, create markets, and run the
full lifecycle
● Demonstrate: create → mint → trade → settle → redeem, end-to-end on testnet
● Tests run locally and validate all key invariants
● Clear README with one-command setup (e.g., make dev or equivalent)
What Does Success Look Like?
● Core contract logic works reliably — minting, trading, settlement, and redemption all
function correctly
● The $1.00 invariant is never violated
● All 4 trade paths functional on the order book
● Settlement executes correctly via oracle within 10 minutes of market close
● Frontend displays real-time prices, order books (both perspectives), positions, and
settlement outcomes
● Position constraints enforced — users cannot hold both Yes and No tokens for the same
strike from trading
● Clear, defensible trade-offs documented — architecture decisions, alternatives
considered, known limitations
Bonus: Mainnet Deployment
● Deploy to Solana mainnet-beta (or equivalent production chain) with real infrastructure
● Funded automation wallet, production oracle feeds, production order book markets
● Monitoring and alerting for daily operations
● This is not required to pass but demonstrates production readiness
